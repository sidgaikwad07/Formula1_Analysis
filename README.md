### 3.10) Pit Stop Strategy Optimisation
#### a) Objective: Identify the most influential factors in optimizing pit stop strategy.
#### b) Conclusions
               precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.70      0.62      0.66      1654
           1       0.66      0.73      0.69      1648

      accuracy                         0.68      3302
     macro avg       0.68      0.68    0.68      3302
    weighted avg     0.68      0.68    0.68      3302
##### The best model is the LightGBM algorithm, tuned with hyperparameter tuning to achieve a 68% accuracy in choosing the best pit stop strategy. For Class 0, this had a precision of 70%, which shows that the model was correct about 70% of the time for the finishes that were not in the top 5 while having a recall of 62%; this means 62% of actual non-top-5 outcomes have been identified by the model. These are balanced by the F1-score, standing at 66%. In the case of Class 1, Top 5 Finish, the precision was 66%, with the recall being higher at 73%, showing that the model was very strong in identifying top-5 finishes, with an F1-score of 69%.
##### The macro and weighted average F1-scores of 68% show that the performance for both classes is balanced, considering class imbalance, which was effectively handled using SMOTE. That will say how strong the model is to cope with an imbalanced dataset. One possible line of improvement can be trying to improve Recall Class 0 and Overall Accuracy by engineering new data, trying advanced feature selections, or ensemble techniques. The following workflow finally sums up class imbalance handling, hyperparameter tuning, and explainability all combined to find an optimal strategy to make a pit stop in Formula 1.

#### c) Visualisation: Using SHAP Summary plots and Feature Importance Plots
#### 1) Analysis of Figures
#### 1.1) Feature Importance Plot: The first plot shows the relative importance of features used in the LightGBM model for the task of predicting optimal pit stop strategies. The most influencing feature is pit_duration, meaning that the time spent in the pit is highly important to predict if a top-5 finish is likely. Other features such as lat, lng, alt, and year feature, however, have lower importance though they are also contributing to this prediction.
![Feature Importance](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Q7x3bwMkfvqhta2Jv7dS69Mm4ZG3jHPk)

#### 1.2) What is SHAP Summary plot & Explanation of our results
#### Q) What is SHAP Summary plot?
##### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a tool based on game theory that explains machine learning predictions by quantifying each featureâs contribution. It enhances model transparency, identifies critical features, builds trust in complex models, and provides both global and local explanations, aiding interpretability and decision-making, particularly in high-stakes applications like Formula 1 strategy optimization.
#### Explanation of our Results
#### The SHAP plot provides an explainability perspective on how each feature values impact the model's prediction. The color red represents high feature values, while blue represents low feature values. Also, similar to the feature importance plot, pit_duration has the biggest impact, and a higher value, as represented in red, normally reduces the likelihood of top-5 finishes. Features such as year, alt, and lat have a more nuanced impact on the predictions, at times positively depending on their value or vice versa. This detailed visualization helps understand the direction and magnitude of feature effects.

### 3.11) Prediction of Top 5 Finish
#### a) Objective: Predict whether a driver will finish in the top 5 based on qualifying results, driver/team form, and track characteristics.
#### b) Conclusions
Accuracy: 0.86
ROC AUC: 0.91
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.90      0.92      0.91       802
           1       0.74      0.69      0.71       264

      accuracy                           0.86      1066
     macro avg       0.82      0.81      0.81      1066
    weighted avg     0.86      0.86      0.86      1066
##### The predictive model yielded an accuracy of 81% and a very strong ROC AUC score of 0.86, hence establishing its efficiency in predicting whether a driver will finish in the top 5. Precisely, from the classification report for Class 0 (Not Top 5 Finish), it has a precision of 86% and a recall of 90%, indicating that the model is good at identifying the correct non-top-5 finishes. Class 1, Top 5 Finish: The model did a relatively weak job with Class 1, having precision of 64% and recall of 55%, hence showing further room for improvement regarding capturing top-5 finishes.
##### The feature importance plot identifies the position of qualification as the most deciding factor in Top 5 finishes, followed by the year of the race. The track characteristics like latitude, longitude, and altitude have a lesser influence on the outcome. In summary, the model shows very strong predictive power and actionable insights into some key factors driving race outcomes; however, it can be further improved by enhancing its utility in handling Class 1 predictions.

#### c) Visualisation: Using feature importance and ROC-AUC Curve
#### 1) Conclusion of feature importance
##### The feature importance plot highlights qualifying position as the most influential predictor for top-5 finishes, followed by average pit stop time. Geographic and track-specific variables like latitude, longitude, and altitude have minimal impact, emphasizing the importance of race-day performance metrics in the prediction.
![Feature Importance Plot for Top 5 Finish](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16MOKAWyyz4wP1zkX1xkL5ppf_LNIeODh)

#### 2) ROC-AUC Curve
##### The ROC-AUC curve demonstrates the model's strong predictive performance, achieving an AUC score of 0.91. This indicates that the RandomForestClassifier effectively differentiates between drivers likely to finish in the top 5 and those who won't, with a high degree of accuracy across various decision thresholds.
